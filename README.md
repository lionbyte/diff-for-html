# [Diff for HTML](#)

Diff for HTML is a JavaScript library for comparing two blocks of HTML as plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.

- **Diff-Match-Params Based:** We found that using Google's library is extremely incovenient for this use. So we took the liberty of improving this to work with HTML.
- **Write Anywhere:** You can use this on the front-end as well as the back-end.

## Installation

Go to the root of your project and run:
`npm i diff-for-html`

Or if you use yarn:
`yarn add diff-for-html`

## Examples

I'll try to update here more examples. Here is the first one to get you started:

```javascript
import { diff_html } from 'diff-for-html'

const html1 = '<p>I love this module</p>'
const html2 = "<p>I love this module, it's awesome</p>"

console.log(diff_html(html1, html2))
```

Expected output:

```
[
  [ 0, '<p>I love this module' ],
  [ 1, ", it's awesome" ],
  [ 0, '</p>' ]
]
<p>I love this module<span class='new-text'>, it's awesome</span></p>
```
