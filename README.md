# [Diff for HTML](#)

Diff for HTML is a JavaScript library for comparing two blocks of HTML as plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.

- **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

Go to the root of your project and run:
`npm i diff-for-html`

Or if you use yarn:
`yarn add diff-for-html`

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```javascript
import { diff_html } from 'diff-for-html'

const html1 = '<p>I love this module</p>'
const html2 = "<p>I love this module, it's awesome</p>"

console.log(diff_html(html1, html2))
```

Expected output:

```
[
  [ 0, '<p>I love this module' ],
  [ 1, ", it's awesome" ],
  [ 0, '</p>' ]
]
<p>I love this module<span class='new-text'>, it's awesome</span></p>
```

This example takes 2 HTML inputs as text and shows the differences of the HTML in the console.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.
